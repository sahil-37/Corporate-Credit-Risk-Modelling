#Corporate Credit Risk Analysis with Python and Financial Modeling Prep API
This project develops a corporate credit risk analysis model using Python and the Financial Modeling Prep API. It collects financial data for NASDAQ-listed companies and calculates key financial ratios. The project employs K-Means clustering to segment companies by credit risk, using Yellowbricks to optimize clustering and rank segments to identify risk levels.

#Features
Data Collection: Fetches financial data (income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements) for NASDAQ-listed companies using the Financial Modeling Prep API.
Financial Ratios Calculation: Computes key financial ratios such as the current ratio, debt to equity ratio, gross profit margin, and return on assets.
Clustering Analysis: Uses K-Means clustering to segment companies based on calculated financial ratios.
Cluster Optimization: Utilizes the Yellowbricks package to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Risk Ranking: Ranks segments to identify companies with varying levels of credit risk.
